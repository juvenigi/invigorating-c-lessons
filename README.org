* Some shoddy C Programming

  Enclosed is a collection of =.c= files (with occasional headers), unhelpful comments, as well as code that compiles most of the time. All made to learn more about C, but it actually makes one learn more about gcc/gdb.


* Contents
- =ln=, where /n/ is a lesson number (l0 happened before the official courses started, basically me messing with code from Wikipedia) 
- =genius= has some expert-level code that only expert mathematicians can comprehend
- =modules= contains code useful for multiple lessons at the same time (even though I could have probably done away with lesson folders altogether and used git tags/commit messages)

* TO BE IMPLEMENTED
-  comrehensive documentation of each lesson
-  function pointers for German translation
-  correct implementation of certain functions
-  proper headers and modules (put them into a library)
-  setup make or cmake to compile code without a hassle
-  follow the ISO C standard (redo some code with =-ansi=, I think)

* Some shoddy C Programming

  Enclosed is a collection of .c files (with occasional headers), unhelpful comments, as well as buggy code that does not even compile every time! I swear, I'm going to fix all of this this weekend, but no promises... All made to learn more about C, but it actually makes one learn more about gcc/gdb instead.

  If you are going to use any of this code for your personal project, I don't think your machine can handle the power of =goto= statments.

* TO BE IMPLEMENTED
  comrehensive documentation of each lesson
  function pointers for German translation
  correct implementation of certain functions
  proper headers and modules (put them into a library)
  setup make or cmake to compile code without a hassle
  follow the ISO C standard (redo some code with =-ansi=, I think)

* Some shoddy C Programming

  Enclosed is a collection of =.c= files (with occasional headers), unhelpful comments, as well as buggy code that does not even compile every time! I swear, I'm going to fix all of this this weekend, but no promises... All made to learn more about C, but it actually makes one learn more about gcc/gdb instead.

  If you are going to use any of this code for your personal project, I don't think your machine can handle the power of =goto= statments.

* Contents
- =ln=, where /n/ is a lesson number (l0 happened before the official courses started, basically me messing with code from Wikipedia) 
- =genius= has some expert-level code that only expert mathematicians can comprehend
- =modules= contains code useful for multiple lessons at the same time (even though I could have probably done away with lesson folders altogether and used git tags/commit messages)

* TO BE IMPLEMENTED
-  comrehensive documentation of each lesson
-  function pointers for German translation
-  correct implementation of certain functions
-  proper headers and modules (put them into a library)
-  setup make or cmake to compile code without a hassle
-  follow the ISO C standard (redo some code with =-ansi=, I think)

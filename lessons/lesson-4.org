* Fourth lesson in C Programming

We have discovered how headers work, and I have not discovered how to generate them quickly in emacs /(there has got to be a way!)/

* Code

** TASK1: write ==mymath.c== and ==mymath.h== as a user library for math functions that were made till this point (l2-l3)
** TASK2: write a log(base,x) (in ==mymath==)
** TASK3: factorial ==mymath==
** TASK4: kth root
** TASK5: use cosine law to find a side of a tringle knowing two sides and an enclosing angle.
** TASK6: binomial equation solver (real roots)
** TASK7: Reeman Zeta function (real numbers only)
** TASK8: add all elements of an array together iteratively
